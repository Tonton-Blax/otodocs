    "title": "Editing text",
    "content": "Editing text\nOtO simplifies the process of editing and managing text for prompter / cued presentations, allowing you to efficiently import, format, and control documents with ease. Whether you're importing content from a .docX file or fine-tuning the formatting within the editor, OtO provides a flexible and intuitive interface designed for professional use.\nIn the following chapters, you'll learn how to import and edit documents, adjust formatting, use prompter mode, and work with markers—all essential skills for mastering OtO's text-editing features. Let's dive in!\nImporting Documents\n\nOtO can import any .docX file. To do so, Either click on the &lt;Icon d=&quot;importWord&quot; /&gt; toolbar icon or click on the File → Import docX menu.\nYou can also Copy → Paste text content from any third-party software though we strongly suggest the .docX import way (less prone to formatting issues)\nYou can select and open multiple files at once, they will appear in the Rundown / Document list panel &lt;Number n=&quot;3&quot;/&gt;.\nTo save your new project, just click on the &lt;Icon d=&quot;save&quot; /&gt; toolbar icon or click on the File → save or File → save as shortcut item and enter a name for your project, it will create a file with a .prompt extension at the selected location.\nYou can also import a project within an existing project by cliking on File → Import project menu item, which will basically merge the imported project with your current project.\n\ntype=tip\nYou may also use keyboard shortcuts(click on the File menu to see the shortcut for some of the above commands)\nEditing Documents\n\nOtO offers basic text processing features, such as &lt;Icon d=&quot;bold&quot; /&gt; bold, &lt;Icon d=&quot;italics&quot; /&gt; italic, &lt;Icon d=&quot;fontColor&quot; /&gt; colors, and &lt;Icon d=&quot;hilite&quot; /&gt; highlighting, as well as font size &lt;Icon d=&quot;fontSize&quot; /&gt; and font family selection &lt;Icon d=&quot;fontFamily&quot; /&gt;.\nSimply select the text you want to format and click the corresponding button on the toolbar.\nWhen it comes to font selection &lt;Icon d=&quot;fontFamily&quot; /&gt;, and font size&lt;Icon d=&quot;fontSize&quot; /&gt;, OtO takes a slightly different approach compared to traditional word processors to better suit the needs of teleprompter presentations. By default, changes made in either of these menus will apply to the entire current document. You can modify this behavior by using the &quot;Apply to&quot; dropdown in the font or size selection menu, where you can choose to apply changes to selected documents (use the rundown &lt;Number n=&quot;3b&quot; /&gt; panel checkboxes to select multiple documents), all documents, or just the selected text.\nFor color selection, the &quot;Hilite&quot; button acts as a toggle: when activated, the chosen color is applied as a highlight. This allows you to quickly apply both a color and a highlight from the same menu. Additionally, keyboard shortcuts CTRL+ALT+1 (⌘+ALT+1 on mac) through CTRL+ALT+5 allow you to directly apply one of the first five colors (the same as in the dropdown menu), and the CTRL+ALT+H shortcut applies a predefined highlight.\n\nYou can also remove any previous formatting by clicking the &lt;Icon d=&quot;clearFormat&quot;/&gt; button.\n\nMini Editor &lt;Number n=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;\nYou may have already noticed that OtO provides two editing windows:  the Prompter Editor Panel &lt;Number n=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;, and the mini editor &lt;Number n=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;. Every time you enter text in the Prompter Editor, the text is updated in the mini-editor and vice versa.\nThe top portion of the prompter editor displays exactly what the speaker sees on the external screen. This is the &quot;Prompter Safe View&quot;,\nHowever, since the font size in this view is often very large, editing text directly can be cumbersome. Additionally, it’s difficult to anticipate upcoming text or get a comprehensive overview of the content.\nThis is where the mini-editor&lt;Number n=&quot;2&quot; /&gt; comes in handy—it allows you to easily navigate through the document, preview the text ahead, and work on other sections without affecting the prompter screen. When you scroll within the mini-editor, it does not move the prompter display, allowing the speaker to stay focused on their current section while the operator works elsewhere.\nThis secondary editing window gives you the freedom to manage the text without disturbing the speaker’s flow, providing a powerful tool for operators. Here’s how you can make the most of it:\n\nThe mini-editor allows you to preview and navigate through the upcoming text while in prompter mode. You can scroll through the mini-editor without affecting the current position of the prompter screen, ensuring the speaker’s view remains uninterrupted.\nYou can even edit the text directly in the mini-editor. However, be cautious—if you modify any text that appears before the speaker’s current position, the prompter will adjust and shift by a few lines.\nFor added convenience, you can Sync (or rather “link”) the scrolling of the mini-editor to the Prompter Editor Panel by clicking the &lt;TextIcon text=&quot;Sync&quot; icon=&quot;sync&quot; /&gt; button. This creates a one-way sync, ensuring that what is displayed in the mini-editor matches what is shown in the Prompter Editor panel.\n\ntype=info\nWhen lost between the two editing panels ( &lt;Number n=&quot;2&quot;/&gt; and  &lt;Number n=&quot;4&quot;/&gt; ), you can easiliy find your way back by selecting one or several words in the Prompter Editor or the mini-editor before clicking the Jump button &lt;Number n=&quot;7&quot;/&gt;, OtO will find the same selection in its counterpart editor.\ntype=tip\nIf you're using OtO as a presentation helper tool rather than a teleprompting tool, you can enlarge the black &quot;Prompter Safe View&quot; to the whole Editor Panel by setting the Aspect Ratio Setting in Settings → General to &quot;disable&quot;\nRundown Panel &lt;Number n=&quot;3&quot;/&gt;\nFor a comprehensive overview of all the features available in this panel, refer to the dedicated chapter. In the meantime, here's a brief introduction:\n\nthe Rundown panel displays a list of all imported project documents.\nYou can select multiple documents using the checkboxes &lt;Number n=&quot;3b&quot; /&gt; beside each document.\nThe topmost checkbox allows you to select all documents at once.\nThe active document (the one currently scrolling in the Prompter Editor is signaled with a red dot &lt;Round/&gt;).\nNotice the current document progress indicator (not to be confused with the global progress indicator)\n\n\nMarkers &lt;Number n=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;\nFor a full understanding of OtO's powerful marker system, make sure to read the main chapter and its sub-sections. However, here's a quick guide to get you started:\nThe Markers sub-panel &lt;Number n=&quot;5&quot;/&gt; keeps track of markers (which function like bookmarks). You can toggle the visibility of this sub-panel by clicking the &lt;Icon d=&quot;showMarkers&quot; /&gt; button.\n\nTo create a marker, select a short piece of text (1 to 3 words) in either the mini-editor &lt;Number n=&quot;4&quot;/&gt; or the Prompter Editor Panel &lt;Number n=&quot;2&quot;/&gt; and click the &lt;Icon d=&quot;addMarker&quot; /&gt; toolbar button (or CTRL+M or ⌘+M on mac). If you create a marker on text that already has one, doing this again will remove the existing marker.\nTo jump to a marker, click the &lt;Icon d=&quot;gotoDoc&quot; /&gt; button next to the marker in the Markers sub-panel &lt;Number n=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;. This will scroll either the mini-editor &lt;Number n=&quot;4&quot;/&gt; or the Prompter Editor Panel &lt;Number n=&quot;2&quot;/&gt; to that marker, depending on which one was last active.\nTo delete a marker, double-click the &lt;Icon d=&quot;trash&quot; /&gt; icon (this is designed to prevent accidental deletions).\n\ntype=info\nMarkers are a key feature of OtO, and we strongly recommend reading the dedicated chapters to fully leverage their potential.",

The topmost checkbox selects all documents.\n\nThe &lt;Number n=&quot;3F&quot; /&gt; ... dots at the end of each document line open the  document tools, a collection of helping features on a per-document basis\nAs for the &lt;Number n=&quot;3G&quot; /&gt; ... dots, they open the global document tools menu that allows you either to trigger actions for all selected documents or actions not related to any specific document (like AI powered text corrections, global .docX export etc.)\nThe &lt;Round isGray=true /&gt;status button becomes &lt;Round /&gt; red when the document is active (meaning, the actual currently scrolling document on the prompter screen)\nYou will find two progress indicators: one for the active document (On the same line as the red dot, under the 'progress' column title) and the overall progress indicator (corresponding to the entire rundown), located above the search field.\nUnder the duration column title, you'll find a small &quot;widget&quot; which displays duration related metadata.\nClick on the little clock &lt;Icon d=&quot;clock&quot; fill=&quot;none&quot; stroke=&quot;white&quot; noborder /&gt; icon, the widget will now display the wordcount of the document, and the cumulative wordcount if several documents are opened. Click again to get the cumulative time.\nThe &lt;Icon d=&quot;gotoDoc&quot; /&gt; button at the end of the line will directly scroll the Prompter Editor Panel to the beginning of the document\nYou can reorder the documents by drag and dropping them (click and hold any empty zone around the document title, you will see the mouse cursor become a hand, now drag the line before or between another document)\n\nDocument Tools\nThe document tools menu, accessible by clicking on the three dots ... at the end of each document's row (or with a right click on the row), offers a variety of useful options. While most are self-explanatory, here are some detailed explanations for a few of them:\n\n\nInsert Line Breaks: Adds line breaks after most punctuation marks to improve readability, especially with larger font sizes.\ntype=tip\nWhile the Insert Line Breaks algorithm works well in most cases, it's important to proofread the text afterward. Some punctuation may be misinterpreted, causing unwanted line breaks.\nSplit at Cursor: Splits the text at the cursor position, creating a new document from the second half.\nAllow Hyphens: Activates dynamic hyphenation without altering the actual text. The hyphenation reflects the document's language, which can be manually adjusted if incorrectly detected. You can turn off this feature at any time without needing to reformat the text.\nEnhance Text Balance: Activates the &quot;Balanced Text&quot; mode, which prevents widows and orphans (e.g., single short words on a line), restructuring the overall text for improved readability. Like hyphenation, this feature doesn't alter the actual text and can be toggled off without reformatting.\nDocument Language: Allows you to manually change the document's language to optimize hyphenation and improve AI-powered features (see below).\n\ntype=warning\nNetwork Mode &amp; Text Formatting Features\nPlease note that when Network Mode is active, the options Enhance Text Balance and Allow Hyphens will be disabled. This is because the rendering of these features heavily depends on the display settings of each individual computer, which could cause inconsistencies across devices.\nGlobal Document Tools\nThe global document tools (accessible via the three dots ... at the top of the Rundown panel) allow you to perform actions across the entire document set:\n\n\nInsert New: Inserts a new document at the top of the list.\nDelete: Removes all selected documents.\nLanguage Detection: If the language is not correctly detected, you can manually select the language at the bottom of the same dropdown menu (see below).\nConvert to docX: Converts all selected documents into a single Word file.\nOtO AI: Opens a submenu to apply a generative AI module to the currently selected text (the AI applies to a portion of selected text within either editor &lt;Number n=&quot;2&quot; /&gt; or &lt;Number n=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;).\nThis submenu includes &quot;preset prompts&quot; optimized for teleprompting / cue-based talks. There is also a custom prompt where you can enter any transformation that will apply to the selected text.\n\nOtO AI Configuration\nIn the Settings panel under the &quot;General&quot; section, you can modify the type of AI model you want to use.\n\n\nLocal Model: If you want to use a local model, first select &quot;Local model&quot; under the &quot;AI provider&quot; option. Then, in the line below, browse for a compatible .gguf file.

Here are some practical tips to help new operators:\nAdapt\n\nThe most important tip for teleprompting is the operator must always adapt to the speaker's pace, not the other way around. It's the operator's responsibility to ensure the text scrolls at a comfortable speed for the speaker, maintaining a smooth flow.\n\nCommunication\n\nFor speakers using a teleprompter for the first time, it’s crucial to communicate this upfront. Let them know that they are in control—they don’t need to rush or follow the scrolling; the operator will adjust to their natural speaking rhythm. This helps put them and the team at ease and improves the overall experience.\n\nKnow the Script Inside Out\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the content before the session begins. Understanding the tone, pacing, and structure of the script will help you anticipate when the speaker may need to pause, slow down, or speed up\n\nMaintain Eye Contact with the Speaker\n\nAs the operator, you need to monitor the speaker. Watch their facial expressions, gestures, and breathing to gauge their pace. This allows you to adjust the scrolling speed in real-time.\n\nStart Slowly\n\nIn the beginning, it's better to scroll slower than you think is necessary. Speakers tend to start cautiously and build up their pace. Starting slow helps them settle in without feeling rushed.\n\nUse Shortcuts &amp; Controllers Efficiently\n\nGet comfortable with OtO’s keyboard shortcuts or external controllers (like Shuttle Xpress) to adjust speed or navigate between sections. These shortcuts will save time and help you manage the flow without disrupting your focus.\n\nAdjust Prompting Speed Gradually\n\nAvoid making sudden speed adjustments. If the speaker accelerates, smoothly increase the scrolling speed. A sudden change can confuse the speaker and break their concentration.\n\nPractice Syncing with the Speaker\n\nEvery speaker has a unique rhythm. Whether they read fast or slow, practice staying in sync with them, especially during rehearsals. This practice ensures smoother coordination during live events.\n\nPrepare for Unexpected Changes\n\nSpeakers often improvise or skip sections. Stay calm and quickly jump to the appropriate section using markers or scroll manually. OtO's action markers and keyboard shortcuts can help you do this efficiently.\n\nStay Focused Throughout\n\nTeleprompting requires constant attention. Avoid distractions during the presentation at all cost, as losing focus for just a few seconds could throw off the speaker's flow.\n\nBy following these tips and practicing regularly, you’ll quickly become confident in operating the teleprompter smoothly and effectively!",

The marker will appear as text surrounded by a border, accompanied by its &quot;description&quot; in a small box at the bottom left of the marker, like this:\n&lt;Q type=&quot;marker&quot; text=&quot;NORMAL MARKER&quot; /&gt;\nBy default, this description will take the value of the marker text itself.\nThe marker will then be listed in the marker panel, which displays a list of all the markers from all documents, in the order they appear in the texts.

In OtO, this is called a Network Action Marker.\nCreating a Static Network Action Marker\nLet’s walk through an example to better understand how to create these custom markers.\nCustom action markers function just like &quot;regular&quot; actionMarkers, but you need to define their specific details beforehand.\nLet’s assume you want to control a Blackmagic HyperDeck using the excellent Banyan AVBridge.\nAccording to the documentation, the OSC command to send is /hyperdeck/play-single-clip/{x}, where {x} refers to the video number in the HyperDeck.\nWe will first create a &quot;static&quot; custom marker, meaning a marker with a single command to trigger one action, for example, to play video number 2.\nNote the IP\nNote the IP&quot;|orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;\nNote the IP address of the machine you want to connect to, as well as the port (the default is port 3333).\nAdd the New Marker\nAdd the New Marker&quot;|orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;\nIn OtO, go to the settings and click the green &quot;Add&quot; button.\nA modal window will appear with various fields:\n\nFill the required information\nFill the required information&quot;|orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;\n\nIn the &quot;Network Type&quot; field, choose OSC.\nIn the &quot;Port&quot; field, add the server port or ignore the field for default value\nIn &quot;Group name&quot; field, add something you will remember, like deck\nIn the &quot;command&quot; field, add the actual command, which is just 2 (the video clip we want to trigger)\n\nAddress/Command configuration\nAddress/Command configuration&quot;|orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;\nIn the &quot;URL / Address&quot; field, enter the following:\n10.10.7.10/hyperdeck/play-single-clip/\n(Replace 10.10.7.10 with the IP address of the remote machine.\nYou should see in the Network Setting Window a new entry below the green &lt;TextIcon text=&quot;add&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; bgColor=&quot;#367a59&quot; icon=&quot;add&quot; /&gt; button with a reference to the maker we just created (note the trash and pen icon, to respectively edit or delete the marker)\n\nCreate Marker\nCreate Marker&quot;|orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;\nNext, create an actionMarker as we discussed in the previous chapter (select one or more words, then press the &lt;Icon d=&quot;addMarker&quot; /&gt; or use CTRL+M or ⌘+M on mac).\nSave\nSave&quot;|orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;\nRename it to declare it as an actionMarker, using the syntax group:command. For our example, it would be://deck:2\n\nWe should now be able to trigger our shiny all new actionMarker, as a command that sends the previously defined OSC command to the Blackmagic HyperDeck. When triggered during your presentation, this marker will play the designated clip on the HyperDeck.\nCreating a Dynamic Network Action Marker\nIf you have many videos or events to trigger, it can quickly become tedious and inefficient to configure in the settings panel a new marker each time. In this case, you can create a dynamic marker.\nLet’s go back to the example of video clips triggered via the address /hyperdeck/play-single-clip/{x}, where &quot;x&quot; can be any number (as long as the video exists in the HyperDeck).\nWe will do the same on our side.\nThe creation process is identical to static markers, so follow the steps up to step 5:\n\n\nLeave the &quot;command&quot; field empty (since the command is dynamic and will be interpreted at trigger time).\n\n\nIn the address field, enter:\n10.10.7.10:3333/hyperdeck/play-single-clip/{{command}}\nHere, {{command}} acts as a placeholder, just like {x} in Banyan AVBridge’s documentation, allowing for a variable value.\n\n\nSave, and you can now quickly create as many markers as you have clips by renaming them, for example, //deck:2, //deck:3, etc.\n\n\nThis setup makes it easy to handle multiple dynamic events without needing to manually define each action in advance.\ntype=info\nHTTP SERVERS\nhttp servers work the same way, they're just more customizable since http is a more generic protocol. If you need to connect to an http server, you'll need to refer to the documentation of the server you wish to connect to check what method (POST or GET) is required.\nYou can add headers and body information with a JSON syntax (check the placeholders to get an example of how those should be formatted)",

In this case, you can create a dynamic marker.\nLet’s go back to the example of video clips triggered via the address /hyperdeck/play-single-clip/{x}, where &quot;x&quot; can be any number (as long as the video exists in the HyperDeck).\nWe will do the same on our side.\nThe creation process is identical to static markers, so follow the steps up to step 5:\n\n\nLeave the &quot;command&quot; field empty (since the command is dynamic and will be interpreted at trigger time).\n\n\nIn the address field, enter:\n10.10.7.10:3333/hyperdeck/play-single-clip/{{command}}\nHere, {{command}} acts as a placeholder, just like {x} in Banyan AVBridge’s documentation, allowing for a variable value.\n\n\nSave, and you can now quickly create as many markers as you have clips by renaming them, for example, //deck:2, //deck:3, etc.\n\n\nThis setup makes it easy to handle multiple dynamic events without needing to manually define each action in advance.\ntype=info\nHTTP SERVERS\nhttp servers work the same way, they're just more customizable since http is a more generic protocol. If you need to connect to an http server, you'll need to refer to the documentation of the server you wish to connect to check what method (POST or GET) is required.\nYou can add headers and body information with a JSON syntax (check the placeholders to get an example of how those should be formatted)",

This enables two main use cases:\n\nAllows a speaker with a tablet or smartphone to move freely on stage or in a studio without having to rely solely on a camera prompter or speaker prompter.\nUse a tablet as a wireless camera prompter screen.\n\nHow to use OtOView:\n\nSet up an OtO computer as the network &quot;master&quot;.\nDownload the app from the Google PlayStore (it will soon be available for Apple tablets and smartphones).\nEnsure the tablet or smartphone is connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\nFrom OtO’s network menu &lt;Icon d=&quot;network&quot; stroke=&quot;none&quot; fill=&quot;#ef4444&quot;/&gt; of the Master computer click on the button &lt;TextIcon icon=&quot;qrCode&quot; text=&quot;QRCODE&quot; /&gt;.\nScan this QRCode from the mobile app by clicking on &lt;Number n=&quot;＋&quot;/&gt; then on &lt;Icon d=&quot;qrCode&quot; noborder /&gt;.\nYou’re connected, and the device will now appear in the list of network devices.\nRepeat the procedure to connect other phones or tablets.\n\n\nOtOView Options\n\nBy clicking on &lt;Number n=&quot;＋&quot;/&gt; and then on &lt;Icon d=&quot;params&quot; /&gt;, you access options to show or hide specific information.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nMost network connection issues arise from incorrect connection order. Be sure to follow the steps outlined above.\nNote that some connected computers or mobile devices may not immediately appear as offline after exiting or if the app crashes.\nIt's recommended not to connect more than roughly a dozen of devices (mobiles and computers combined) at once. OtO’s serverless network architecture requires a full mesh topology, which could cause issues if too many machines are interconnected.\n\nAlso, take a look at the faq section",
