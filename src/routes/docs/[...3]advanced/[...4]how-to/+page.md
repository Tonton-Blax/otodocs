### In network mode, can I connect different computers with different OS and resolutions?
In theory, yes, you can connect computers with different operating systems and resolutions. We've worked hard to ensure high display fidelity across various types of computers.

However, if you've chosen the network license, it's likely because you want to provide the highest level of security for your clients. The best way to ensure that level of reliability is to use computers of the same series, running the same operating system and with matching screen resolutions.

#### I installed the "OtOView" app on my mobile device but I can't see the QRCode
Ensure you've enabled Network Mode in `Settings` → `Network` then `Enable OtO network`, and also `Set this computer as OtO network Master`.
Save settings.
Then from OtO’s network menu <Icon d="network" stroke="none" fill="#ef4444"/>, click on the button <TextIcon icon="qrCode" text="QRCODE" />.

If you still can't see any of these options in the `Settings` Panel, you probably don't have the OtO **Network Edition** (you can check this by clicking the **Help** → **About** application menu, OtO edition name will appear, either *Demo*, *Freelance*, *Live* or *Network*).
