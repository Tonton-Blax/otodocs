## Registration

When you open OtO, you will see this registration module:

![registration](/registration.jpg)

- If you already have a license, fill in the necessary fields and click *"Register."* Note that your serial number is tied to a security key present on your computer. You can reinstall OtO on another computer if necessary, but you should **not** use the same license on multiple computers simultaneously. Doing so may result in your license being permanently deactivated.

- You can obtain a free or paid license by clicking the "Buy License" button or visiting [https://oto.software#licensing](https://oto.software#licensing).

## OtO Demo

The free demo versions allows you to test all features from every OtO flavour. It's unlimited in time and only displays a watermark in the Prompter Panel region as well as in the external window. It will also triggers a gentle popup reminder to support OtO from time to time.

<!-- The **Freelance**, **Live** and **Network** editions unlock the following features: -->
