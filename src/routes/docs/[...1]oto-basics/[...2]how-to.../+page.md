## Registration

When you open OtO, you will see this registration module:

- If you already have a license, fill in the necessary fields and click *"Register."* Note that your serial number is tied to a security key present on your computer. You can reinstall OtO on another computer if necessary, but you should **not** use the same license on multiple computers simultaneously. Doing so may result in your license being permanently deactivated.

- The demo mode gives you access to all OtO features, including the "Network" version. It is not time-limited, but it will display a watermark on the prompter screen.

- You can obtain a license by clicking the "Buy License" button or visiting [https://teleprompter.best#licensing](https://teleprompter.best#licensing).

## Changing Your License

You can deactivate your current license at any time to activate a new one. Here's how:
- Go to the `Help` menu and click `Disable your OtO license`.
- Restart the application to display the registration module again.
